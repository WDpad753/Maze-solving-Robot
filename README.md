# Maze-solving-Robot

The aim of the project was achieved by programming the microcontrollers combined with a sensor, wireless communication, data logger and motor drive circuit. The project consisted of programming the main robot to solve a maze, map it, store the map and transmit it to a follower robot. This allowed the follower robot to use the instructions received to navigate through the maze.
